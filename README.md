# Nueral_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks to  help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether foundation applicants will be successful if funded by the organization.  
## Results
### Data PreProcessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column is the target for our model.
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The remaining dataframe variables are considered to be the features for our model.
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
We removed the 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns because they were neither targets nor features. 
### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance? 
The target model was 75%, but was only able to achieve 72.3%.
